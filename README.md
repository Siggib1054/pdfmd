## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

Many PDF converters silently upload documents to remote servers. This tool does **not**.

* **No uploads**
* **No telemetry**
* **No cloud processing**
* **No background requests**

Every step, extraction, OCR, reconstruction, and rendering happens **locally on your machine**.

### Trusted for Sensitive Workflows

This project is intentionally designed for environments where confidentiality is non‑negotiable:

* **Medical:** clinical notes, diagnostic reports
* **Legal:** case files, evidence bundles, sworn statements
* **Government:** policy drafts, restricted documents
* **Academic research:** paywalled journals, unpublished materials, field papers
* **Corporate:** financials, architecture documents, IP‑sensitive designs

If your documents must remain under your control, this tool meets that standard.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

A modular pipeline ensures clarity, stability, and extensibility.

| Module           | Purpose                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **extract.py**   | PDF extraction + OCR fallback/selection                            |
| **transform.py** | Text cleaning, paragraphing, hyphen logic, heading inference       |
| **render.py**    | Markdown output generation + asset handling                        |
| **pipeline.py**  | Orchestrates the full extraction → transform → render sequence     |
| **utils.py**     | Platform helpers, OCR checks, filesystem tools, structured logging |
| **models.py**    | Typed configuration + document models                              |
| **app_gui.py**   | The polished Tkinter interface with profiles, themes, persistence  |
| **cli.py**       | Command-line interface for automation and batch workflows          |

**Design Philosophy:** small modules with single responsibilities — easy to read, test, and extend.

## 🧩 OCR Strategy — Dual‑Engine Intelligence

| Platform    | Default OCR Engine | Notes                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Windows** | Tesseract          | Lightweight and reliable for mixed PDFs          |
| **macOS**   | OCRmyPDF           | High‑fidelity layout preservation                |
| **Linux**   | OCRmyPDF           | Strong for research servers and batch automation |

### Auto‑OCR Behavior

* Detects installed engines
* Chooses the best available
* Falls back safely and automatically
